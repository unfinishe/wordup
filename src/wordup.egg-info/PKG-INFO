# WordUp - A Vocabulary Trainer

This outlines the core features for **WordUp**, a dedicated vocabulary trainer designed to support users in effective language acquisition. The application's foundation is the scientifically proven **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**.

## Core Functionality

### Voca-Card Management

* **Multi-Language Support:** The application must support the definition and learning of vocabulary pairs across **multiple languages** (e.g., German ↔ English).
* **Custom Input & Editing:** Users must be able to **enter, create, and fully edit** their own vocabulary entries (flashcards).
* **Chapter Organization:** Vocabulary entries must be **organized and stored in custom-named chapters** (sets) for structured learning.
* **Chapter Selection:** Users can **select specific chapters** to focus their current learning session.
* **Contextual Example Sentences:** Users must be able to **input and display an example sentence** for each vocabulary entry to understand the word's usage in context.

### Learning Process & Methods

* **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** The core learning process utilizes a **Flashcard Box System** (Leitner System or similar SRS algorithm) to ensure words are reviewed at optimal, increasing intervals for long-term retention.
* **Directional Learning:** Users can choose the direction of the practice:
    * **Foreign Language to Native Language**
    * **Native Language to Foreign Language**
    * **Random Direction** (Mixing both directions)

### Progress Tracking

* **Success Rate Display:** **Success Rates (0-100%)** are calculated and displayed per chapter, providing immediate feedback on mastery.
* **Stats Management:** Users must be able to **reset** their progress statistics per chapter or for the entire language.
* **Review Queue:** The application must clearly display the **count of words currently due for review** according to the SRS algorithm, encouraging the user to start a session.
